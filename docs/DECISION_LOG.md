# KinCall — Decision Log

This file records approved deviations from `docs/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

Do not record ordinary implementation details here. Record only decisions that change or clarify the frozen technical baseline.

## DEC-001 — Initial architecture baseline

**Date:** 28 July 2026  
**Status:** Approved

### Decision

Use:

- Next.js and TypeScript;
- Supabase PostgreSQL;
- CALL-E REST API;
- deterministic state-machine orchestration;
- fake and live CALL-E adapters;
- Claude Code as a development tool.

Do not use n8n, the Claude API or a generic agent framework in the MVP runtime.

### Reason

This is the smallest architecture that supports the frozen KinCall workflow while remaining testable, understandable and reliable during the hackathon.

### Consequences

- CALL-E handles calls and structured extraction.
- KinCall code handles decisions and contact selection.
- The complete workflow must work in fake mode before live integration.
- All future baseline changes require a new decision entry.
