// The factual brief a trusted contact is told when KinCall calls them
// (docs/DECISION_LOG.md DEC-022).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// `collectInformationToShare` (engine.ts) derives a closed vocabulary of short
// canned facts — "asked for help", "mentioned a fall" — from the Companion
// result's yes/no/unknown fields. That vocabulary is deliberately closed
// (§17.3: transmit only what is necessary; a free-text reason can never smuggle
// in a medical interpretation), and it stays exactly as it is.
//
// But it cannot express WHAT the help was about. A live test found the real
// consequence: a person asked for help completing an administrative document,
// and every contact was told only that she "asked for help" — true, and
// useless. The specific context was never lost or unpersisted; it was sitting
// in `neutral_summary`, which the cascade simply never read.
//
// This module turns that already-validated, already-persisted free text into
// ONE sentence a relative can act on, WITHOUT enumerating situations. There is
// no list of known contexts here and there must never be one: an administrative
// document, a broken boiler and a lost set of keys all work through the same
// single path, because the sentence is the person's own reported words rather
// than a lookup.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT
//
// It never decides anything. `decideCompanionAction` alone decides whether
// attention is required, from the categorical fields only, exactly as before —
// this brief is downstream of that decision and informs the conversation only.
// It is never a diagnosis, never a claim KinCall verified anything, never a
// transcript (no transcript is stored anywhere — see DEC-022), and never raw
// JSON or an internal enum.

//
// The length floor is deliberately tiny: it rejects "", " ", "n/a" and other
// non-summaries without ever second-guessing a genuinely terse but real
// summary. It is NOT a confidence threshold and must not become one — the
// product does not rank how good a summary is, it only checks that one exists.

// Builds the brief from an already-validated, already-normalized Companion
// result. `null` means the stored result could not be read at all (a malformed
// or entirely unrecognised shape) — the cascade still runs, because it was
// triggered precisely because nothing could be validated, and the contact is
// told plainly that the check-in could not be completed.
//
// Source precedence, highest first. Each step is a strictly weaker claim than
// the one above it, so the brief degrades safely rather than inventing detail:
//
//   1. A usable `neutral_summary` — the person's own reported words. Works for
//      any situation, including ones nobody anticipated.
//   2. `person_reached === "no"` — no conversation happened, so there is no
//      summary worth trusting; say exactly that.
//   3. `explicit_help_requested === "yes"` with no usable summary — we know
//      they asked for help but not what for; say only that.
//   4. Nothing specific — a generic sentence naming no situation at all.
//
// Note 2 sits ABOVE 3 on purpose: if nobody was reached, an "asked for help"
// flag cannot be trusted either, and claiming a request that was never heard
// would be fabricating context.
