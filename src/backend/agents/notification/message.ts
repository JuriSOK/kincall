// What KinCall tells the monitored person once the trusted-circle outcome is
// settled (docs/DECISION_LOG.md DEC-023).
//
// Pure and total: it takes already-persisted, already-validated facts and
// returns sentences. It reads no clock, no database and no environment, so a
// replaying worker produces byte-identical wording — which matters, because
// this text is what a real person hears.
//
// SPOKEN DIRECTLY TO THE MONITORED PERSON.
//
// This is the one KinCall message addressed TO the person the check-in was
// about, and it must sound like it. A live test produced "Marc confirmed that
// he will visit Claire this afternoon" — spoken to Claire herself — because the
// Family calls' third-person context brief was appended here. That brief is
// written FOR a trusted contact ("Claire told KinCall that…"), so reusing it
// made KinCall talk about its own listener in front of her, and restated a
// problem she already knew she had.
//
// So this message now carries the OUTCOME ONLY. The original reason for the
// call is never repeated: the Family calls still receive the full factual
// context (family/context-brief.ts, unchanged), and this callback says only who
// committed to what, or that nobody did.
//
// WHAT IT MAY NEVER SAY
//
//   * the recipient's own name in a third-person sentence — she is listening;
//   * the original Companion context, in any form;
//   * that the contact has ALREADY visited or called — the commitment is a
//     future intention KinCall recorded, never an action it observed (§7.5);
//   * that KinCall verified anything, or that the person is safe or fine;
//   * "nobody answered" on the unresolved path — contacts may well have
//     answered and declined, and saying otherwise would be false;
//   * any diagnosis, severity, or medical framing;
//   * an internal enum, field name, contact id, or phone number.
//
// PRONOUNS. The contact is always "they". KinCall stores no pronouns for a
// trusted contact, and a relationship label ("daughter", "trusted neighbour")
// is not one — guessing from it would misgender a real person on a real call.
// "They" is correct for everyone and needs no data KinCall does not have.

// to neither a visit nor a call, and `summary` is free text a model wrote FOR A
// THIRD PARTY ("One or two neutral sentences describing what this contact said
// and what they agreed to do" — family/prompt.ts). Rewriting arbitrary prose
// into safe second-person speech is exactly the invention §7.5 forbids, so this
// accepts only an unambiguous "<Contact> will <action>" and rejects everything
// else — including anything that might be referring to the listener:
//
//   * a sentence naming the recipient — she is on the line;
//   * a third-person pronoun, which in these summaries usually means HER;
//   * anything long enough to be narrative rather than a commitment;
//   * anything carrying JSON punctuation or an internal field name.
