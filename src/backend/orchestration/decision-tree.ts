// KinCall makes exactly one operational decision — close, or contact the
// trusted circle. There is no priority tier: the original high/medium/low
// distinction never changed what the cascade did, since every escalation ran
// the identical contact sequence. Keeping a label with no behavioural
// consequence would have implied a graded response that does not exist, which
// is closer to false reassurance than to precision. This is an operational
// decision, not a medical triage — KinCall does not assess severity, only
// whether someone should check in.
//
// Two rules deliberately OVERRIDE whatever attention_required the model
// reported — an explicit request for help, and a failure to reach the person —
// because those are operational facts, not judgements, and a model that
// underrates them must not be able to talk KinCall out of acting.
//
// The only path to a closure is the last rule, and it requires positive
// evidence on every axis. Everything else — including attention_required
// "unknown", unknown reachability, and a result that failed validation
// entirely (handled by the caller) — reaches the trusted circle instead, by
// precaution. Ambiguity is never reported as "nothing unusual" (§7.5: KinCall
// must not assert that someone is safe).
